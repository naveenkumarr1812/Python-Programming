## File Descriptions

Below is a list of Python scripts included in this repository, with short descriptions of what each file does:

- `2D list.py`: Creates and manipulates 2D lists (lists within lists) for structured data storage.
- `Dictionary.py`: Demonstrates how to use dictionaries to store and manage key-value pairs.
- `Exception Handling.py`: Shows how to handle errors using try-except blocks.
- `For loop.py`: Iterates over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.
- `Function.py`: Defines reusable functions to organize and simplify code.
- `Index operator.py`: Accesses specific elements in sequences using index notation.
- `Keyword Arguments.py`: Uses named arguments in functions for clarity and flexibility.
- `List.py`: Creates and manipulates lists to store multiple items in a single variable.
- `Logical Operator.py`: Demonstrates logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) in decision-making.
- `Loop Control Statements.py`: Controls loop execution using break, continue, and pass.
- `MathFunction.py`: Uses built-in Python math functions for calculations.
- `Multiple assignment.py`: Assigns multiple values to variables in a single statement.
- `Nested function calls.py`: Calls functions within functions for streamlined operations.
- `Nested loops.py`: Implements loops within loops for handling complex iterations.
- `Random Module.py`: Generates random numbers and performs randomness-based operations.
- `Return Statement.py`: Returns values from functions for further use.
- `Scope.py`: Explains variable scope (local, global) and how Python manages it.
- `Sets.py`: Demonstrates sets, which store unique values and support mathematical operations.
- `String Format().py`: Formats strings using various methods like f-strings and `.format()`.
- `String.py`: Performs basic string operations and manipulations.
- `StringSlicing.py`: Extracts substrings using slicing techniques.
- `Tuple.py`: Creates and manipulates immutable sequences (tuples).
- `TypeCasting.py`: Converts data types (e.g., int to string, float to int) as needed.
- `Variable.py`: Declares and assigns values to variables.
- `args.py`: Passes a variable number of arguments to a function using `*args`.
- `if Statement.py`: Implements conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control program flow.
- `kwargs.py`: Passes a variable number of keyword arguments using `**kwargs`.
- `main.py`: Serves as the main entry point of the Python program.
- `while loop.py`: Uses while loops to repeat tasks until a condition is met.

## Getting Started

To run any of these scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the desired script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naveenkumarr1812/Python-Programming.git
cd Python-Programming
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you wish to execute.
